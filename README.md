# Probiotics_Trials

This project examines microbiome changes over time after application of the probiotic strain <i>Pseudoalteromonas</i> sp. McH1-7. Experimental setup: 4 colonies of <i>Montastraea cavernosa</i> (each a differnt genotype) were divided into at least 6 fragments and the fragments for each genotype were placed in the same aquarium (4 tanks total, one per genotype). Samples of the water and one of the coral fragments were saved just prior to probiotic application. Live culture of McH1-7 was added to the water and samples of the water were collected 1 hour after application. Water and coral fragments were then collected 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 21 days, and 28 days after probiotic application. Water samples were filtered through a sterivex filter and DNA was extracted from the sterivex filter. Coral fragments were thawed, tissue/mucus was scrapped off, and DNA was extracted from the tissue/mucus. All water and tissue samples were analyzed for the presence of the korormicin gene from the probiotic strain <i>Pseudoalteromonas</i> sp. McH1-7. Additionally, all of the tissue samples were characterized by amplifying and sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. This repository contains scripts for the analysis of the korormicin ddPCR of water and tissue samples as well as analysisnof the 16S libraries from the tissue samples. From this data, we would like to compare the detection of <i>Pseudoalteromonas</i> through ddPCR and 16S analysis. We are also interested in how the microbial community shifts (if at all) to application of the probiotic culture.
